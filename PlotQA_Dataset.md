**Images**

`png` directory contains RGBA images of the scientific plots in `.png` format. The plot images are named as `0.png`, `1.png`, etc.

The plot images for different data splits can be downloaded from the following link:

**Annotations**

`annotations.json` is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents the ground-truth annotations of a plot.
It consists the following fields:
```
models: It is a list of dictionaries. Depending on the type of the plot (single or 2,3,4-multi), 
	the length of the dictionary can vary from 1 to 4. Each dictionary contain the following keys-
		name: Label corresponding to each datapoint.
		color: Color corresponding to the `name` datapoint.
		bboxes: Each bounding box corresponding to the `name` datapoints in the plot.

type: Type of the plot (vbar_categorical, hbar_categorical, dot_line, line).

general_figure_info: It is a dictionary containng the following keys-
		title: Bounding box and the text corresponding to the title of the plot.
		x_axis: Bounding boxes, axis labels, ticks lables corresponding to the x-axis of the plot.
		y_axis: Bounding boxes, axis labels, ticks lables corresponding to the y-axis of the plot.
		legend: Bounding boxes, axis labels, ticks lables corresponding to the legend of the plot.
		plot_info: Bounding box corresponding to the plot.
		figure_info: Bounding box corresponding to the figure.
	
image_index: Image-index corresponding to each image.
```

**Question-Answer pairs**

`qa_pairs.json` is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a question. Each question is represented using the following fields:
```
image_index: Image-index corresponding to the image on which this question is being asked.

question_string: Text of the question.

answer: Answer corresponding to the question `question_string`.

answer_bbox: Bounding box of the answer if the answer comes from the plot itself.

template: Template from which `question_string` is being instantiated.

type: Type of the plot (vbar_categorical, hbar_categorical, dot_line, line).
```

`qa_pairs_v1.json`: This .json file contains 8,190,674 number of question-answer pairs.
