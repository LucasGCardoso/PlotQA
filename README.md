### What is PlotQA?
PlotQA is a VQA dataset with 28.9 million question-answer pairs over 224,377 plots on data from real-world sources and questions based on crowd-sourced question templates. 

### Why PlotQA?
Existing synthetic datasets ([FigureQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07300.pdf), [DVQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08163.pdf)) for reasoning over plots do not contain variability in data labels, real-valued data, or complex reasoning questions. Consequently, proposed models for these datasets do not fully address the challenge of reasoning over plots. In particular, they assume that the answer comes either from a small fixed size vocabulary or from a bounding box within the image. However, in practice this is an unrealistic assumption because many questions require reasoning and thus have real valued answers which appear neither in a small fixed size vocabulary nor in the image. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap between existing datasets and real world plots by introducing PlotQA. Further, 80.76% of the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) questions in PlotQA have answers that are not in a fixed vocabulary.

Few examples of the {plot, question, answer} triplets from the PlotQA dataset are given below:

#### Images

Download images using this <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iKH2lTi1-QxtNUVRxTUWFvUvRHq6HAsZ/view?usp=sharing'>url</a>. The images are all in the same folder and are named as
```
bar_{split}_xxxxxxxx.png
where, 
xxxxxxxx = image_id padded (right justified) to length of 8 characters
split = train, val_easy, or val_hard
```
The images expand to about 6.5 GB.

#### Question Answer Pairs
The question-answer pair can be downloaded from this  <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VKYd3kaiCFziSsSv4SgQJ2T5m7jxuh5u/view?usp=sharing'>url</a>. It consists of three files, one each for three different splits of the dataset named as `{split}_qa.json` It consists the following fields:

```
image: The image filename which the given question-answer pair applies to
question: Question
answer: Answer to the Questions. Remember that (cardinal numbers (1,2,3...) are used when 
	the number denotes the value and words (one,two,three...) are used to denote count
question_type: Denotes whether the question is structure, data or reasoning type
bbox_answer: If the answer is a text in the bar_chart, bounding box in form of [x,y,w,h], else []
question_id: Unique question_id associated with the question
```
The question-answer pairs expand to about 750 MB.

#### Bar-chart metadata
In addition to question-answers, we also provide detailed annotations of every object in the bar-chart that can serve as either the source of additional supervision (Ã  la our SANDY and MOM model) or use it to do additional analysis of your algorithm's performance. 

Metadata for the bar-charts can be downloaded using this <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBz8Ji4TMY7rzTL2_DJCTUEyWR7l16W6/view?usp=sharing'>url</a>. It consists of three files, one each for three different splits of the dataset named as `{split}_metadata.json` It consists the following fields:

```
image: The image filename which the given metadata applies to
bars:
	bboxes: Bounding boxes for different bars (number_of_bars x number_of_legends x 4)
    	names: Names for each bar in the form (number_of_bars x number_of_legends)
	colors: Color of each bar (number_of_bars x number_of_legends)

texts:
	text: The string of the text-block in the bar-chart
    	text_function: The function of text (e.g., title, legend, etc)
    	bbox: The bounding box surrounding the text-block

table: Underlying table used to create the chart saved in the following format.

	single row charts:
		C_1 	C_2 	C_3	...	C_N
		-------------------------------------
		V_1	V_2	V_3	... 	V_N
		
	multi row charts:
		
		None |	C_1 	C_2 	C_3	...	C_N
		-----|---------------------------------------
		R_1  |	V_11	V_21	V_31	... 	V_N1
		R_2  |	V_12	V_22	V_32	... 	V_N2
		...  |	...	...	... 	... 	...
		R_M  |	V_1M	V_2M	V_3M	... 	V_NM
	
```
Since numpy arrays are not supporte by JSON, the tables are saved as nested lists. Converting them to numpy array, e.g., `table = np.array(metadata['table'])` might provide easier access to the elements, e.g., for multi-row charts, `table[1:,1:]` contains the numeric data, `table[1:,0]` contains the row names and `table[0,1:]` contain the column names.

The annotations expand to about 800 MB.
